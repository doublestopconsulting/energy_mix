Explore US energy data

## Data source

[State Energy Data System](https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/seds-data-complete.php?sid=US#CompleteDataFile) from the US Energy Information Administration.

## Initial ideas
- Create a heatmap of energy consumption that evolves over time -- getting brighter as energy consumption increases. See if we can come up with something to mimic the "lights at night" images, like those found on this [NASA Earth Observatory site](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/NightLights).
- A dashboard to show by state & sector a chart over time of the breakdown of energy sources
